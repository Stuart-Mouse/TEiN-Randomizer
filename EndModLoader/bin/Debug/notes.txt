Level Generator Notes

Need to make new editor tiles

Green transition tags will be used to mark entrances in pieces
yellow will mark exits
purple will be used to mark an entrance that doubles as an exit

separate platform pieces from ground pieces
make transitional pieces to connect ground and platforms
establish a convention for bg decoration
build levels to reach 16:9 ratio
cover OOB with Mother?
rules for connecting ceilings

Randomizer additions:
- saved mods page
- re-implement mod loading
- add mod corruptions
  - level corruptions will be easy to add
  - write tileset parser for randomizing other things

- rewrite and re-organize existing code

swf work:
- fix bgsolid seemingly breaking the end's background
- create new menus/world map possibly


create updated modloader?
find out how to fix epic games version



Color Tiles:

add null color tiles
  these are able to connect color tiles without being themselves added to the set of contiguous tiles

reduce color tile brightness, will help visibility
  decor color tiles?

redefine no-place values for yellow, red, green tiles in corruptor tiles

special rules for conveyors, tumors

add springs, kukos

work out how enemies will work
  ignore specifc enemy type when finding contiguous tiles
  place the enemy type of the specific enemy being replaced
  can 

put color tiles into their own section in editor?





Auto-decorator:

start with machine decorating

basically just fug up the windows and add the blinky bits

create some algorithm for adding holes into solid backgrounds?
